# How to create a component without using JSX (the older way)?

Long before `JSX` was introduced in `React`, React developers would create components in a different way. Let's see how the `App.js` would be without using `JSX`:

```sh
import React from 'react';
import ExpenseList from "./components/ExpenseList";

function App() {
    const expenses = [
      {
        description : 'Car Insurance',
        date        : new Date(2020, 2, 19),
        value       : 264.97
      },
      {
        description : 'Guitar Reformation',
        date        : new Date(2020, 2, 20),
        value       : 165.99
      },
      {
        description : 'Supermarket',
        date        : new Date(2020, 2, 21),
        value       : 300.00
      }
    ];
    return React.createElement(
      'div',
      {},
      React.createElement('h2', {}, "Let's get started!");
      React.createElement(ExpenseList, {expenses: expenses})
    );
}

export default App;
```

When `JSX` was introduced, because it was more easier to use tags instead of calling enumerous `createElement()` in one file, it's just a level above to make easier to read and understand. But in the end, React reads the `JSX` tags and transforms it to the `React.createElement()` function.

So this is the reason we can see the `import React from 'react';` code in older projects. Because this were the way components were created in the past. Phew...
