# Building the first custom component

So, we learned about JavaScript, had a overview about React, its structure and JSX syntax. What we do now?

We build a custom component, of course!

## How to?

First, we create a new folder inside the `src` folder, called `components`. This folder will be used to store all components we build over time.

With the folder created, we will create a JavaScript file now: `ExpenseItem.js`. This file will follow the standard procedure of creating a React Component.

```sh
import React from 'react';

function ExpenseItem() {
    return (
        <h2>Expense Item</h2>
    );
}

export default ExpenseItem;
```

After creating the component, we can import it on the `App.js` file as a component to be used. We will not use the component on the `index.js` because its not a good programming practice. You shall always use components on `App.js`, since its there the user interface.

```sh
import ExpenseItem from './components/ExpenseItem';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Lets get started!</h2>
            <ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

It's important to note that when using a create component, we use initial uppercase letters. This way we show to React which tags are built-in JSX and which are custom components.

* Example:
  * `<h2>` (built-in HTML tag, 'h' is lowercase)
  * `<ExpenseItem>` (React component, 'E' and 'I' are uppercase letters)
