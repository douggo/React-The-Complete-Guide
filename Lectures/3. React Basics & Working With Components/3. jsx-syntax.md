# JSX Syntax

Instead of writing ```JavaScript``` native code to create user interfaces, React uses the ```JSX (JavaScript XML)``` syntax.

Looking at the ```App.js``` file, we have the following code:

```sh
function App() {
    return (
        <div>This is a test</div>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    );
}
export default App;
```

```JSX```, as said before, is a way to create ```HTML``` components using ```HTML-ish``` tags while coding in ```JavaScript```. Remember, ```JSX``` is not readable by the browser. React uses this syntax to transcribe everything created to ```JavaScript``` native code.

So, in the start we have the default ```JavaScript``` coding, creating a function. Not unnusual.

But when we return something in the function, we can see some kind of ```HTML``` tags being created. Right? Wrong. Kind of.

Through ```JSX``` syntax we can use the ```HTML``` tags that will be transcribed to native ```JavaScript``` later when the browser load the page.

Someone could say that we can create a div through ```JavaScript```, and I agree to that. But let's see the difference:

```sh
function App() {
    const div     = document.createElement('div'),
          p       = document.createElement('p'),
          rootDiv = document.getElementById('root');
    div.innerHTML('This is a test');
    p.textContent('This is a paragraph');
    rootDiv.append(div);
    rootDiv.append(p);    
}
```

Would you look at that. **How many lines we wrote** to simply create a ```div``` and a ```paragraph``` and add them to the ```root div```? **It's tiresome**.

But it's almost what React does **behind the scene**. It's more easy to the developer create components using the ```JSX``` syntax which **is a lot more efficient** and leave the details to React.
