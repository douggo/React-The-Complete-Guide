# What we'll be learning in this section?

* Handling events (user clicks and more)
* How can we ensure what's visible on screen changes
* State concept and manipulate the state
* Updating the UI & working with 'State'
* A closer look at Components & State

## What we'll be doing before that:

We will change the folder `components`. We will create new folders to split the components into more divided roles:
  
* src
  * components
    * Expenses
    * NewExpense
    * UI

Remember to change the path inside the components!
