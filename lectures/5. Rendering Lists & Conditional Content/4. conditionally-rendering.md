# Conditionally Rendering components

Since we finished building our form component and it's working 100%, we need to actually to hide it and show when necessary.

## First Steps

We need to (when the app is loaded) hide the form and its place create a button that will show our form when clicked. When we add a new expense, the form have to be hidden and the button will appear again.

First we need to add a new `state` on `NewExpense.js` that will tell us if the form is visible or not. By default, the form will never be visible and a button will take it's place with a text 'add new expense'. So, we are going to use conditionally rendering to see what's being rendered by watching the state created.

```sh
//NewExpense.js

const NewExpense = props => {
  const [isFormVisible, setIsFormVisible] = useState(false), // Created the state

  saveExpenseDataHandler = enteredExpenseData => {
    const expense = {
      ...enteredExpenseData,
      id: Math.random().toString()
    };
    props.onAddExpense(expense);
    setIsFormVisible(false); // forcing the form to be hidden
  };

  // We created the FormExpense as the content
  let content = <FormExpense 
    onSaveExpenseData={saveExpenseDataHandler} 
    onClickCancelExpense={() => setIsFormVisible(false)} // we set an function to hide the form if the user clicks the cancel button
  />;

  // But if the state informs us that the form canÂ´t be visible, we need to overwrite the variable to hold the button.
  if(!isFormVisible) {
    content = <button type="button" onClick={() => setIsFormVisible(true)}>Add New Expense</button>
    // The button will have a onClick to show the form again.
  }

  return (
    <div className="new-expense">
      {content}
    </div>
  );

}
```

Now our app is becoming really reactive to the users actions.
